#Desktop App - QR Code Generator

This is a desktop application that generates a QR Code for download at the end. The program runs as a wizard, guiding the user to choose all the information needed to generate a QR Code.
This application also has the ability to add new Licenses, Inventory items and generate Access Keys for use.

Java 1.8 and above is required.

## Running the Desktop App

You can run it by exporting the program as a .jar file or by running it on Eclipse.

Export the program as a Runnable Jar File. For Library handling, select "Package required libraries into generated JAR" and then Export.
Once exported, double click on the JAR file to run the application.


### Important Information
Users will require accounts that have access to these features:
- Bucket Management
- Inventory Managemnet
- Access Key Management
- License Management

Feature names from the Licenses are converted from a file called messages.en which can be found in src/resources. Update this file to change the names that the default feature names get converted to.
